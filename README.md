# BrickHacks-BestBuds
We're a team of RIT students: Alex, Charon, Tim, and Lucy. We wanted to make an app that would help those of us who enjoy the idea of gardening, but don't know where to start. BestBuds is designed to be like a social-media app where you can interact with your plants and discover new ones that would thrive with you. On the app you can add to your feed to create a scrapbook-like memory lane with your plants; you can explore "my plants" to see the profiles of plants that you own; you can go to the "plant book" tab to search the database of plants including general knowledge of every plant you could want; if you need some help getting started with your plants the "tips" tab is there for you; the calendar section will send you SMS messages that remind you to water your plants.

This app helps you better care for your plants, so you can just enjoy the relaxing hobby of gardening. Our mascot is the ladybug because they eat aphids and protect your plants.
